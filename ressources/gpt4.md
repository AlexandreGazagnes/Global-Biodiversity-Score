# [IN] : 
The GBS can assess biodiversity of various commodities such as agricultural crops. The
biodiversity impact results are expressed in MSA.km² (mean species abundance times km²)
and could be detailed by pressure on such as land use or climate change.
The goal of this exercise is to compute the total static biodiversity loss due to land use caused by wheat in every country (in MSA.km²) in 2019.

# [OUT] : 
To calculate the total static biodiversity loss due to land use caused by wheat in every country for the year 2019, expressed in Mean Species Abundance per square kilometer (MSA.km²), you need to follow a series of steps. This process involves data collection, analysis, and calculation. Here's a general outline of how to approach it:

## Data Collection:
- **Wheat Cultivation Data**: Obtain data on the area of land used for wheat cultivation in each country for the year 2019. This data can be sourced from agricultural databases, government reports, or international organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
- **Biodiversity Impact Factors**: Find or calculate the **biodiversity impact factor for wheat cultivation, expressed in MSA.km²**. This factor measures the average impact of a square kilometer of wheat cultivation on local biodiversity. The impact factor can vary by region and cultivation practices.

## Data Analysis:
- Adjusting Impact Factors: If necessary, adjust the biodiversity impact factor for local conditions in each country. Factors like climate, soil type, and agricultural practices can affect the impact of wheat cultivation on biodiversity.
- Calculate Biodiversity Loss: **For each country, multiply the area of land used for wheat cultivation by the biodiversity impact factor (in MSA.km²)** for wheat. This will give you the total biodiversity loss due to wheat cultivation in each country.

## Summarize Results:
- Total Biodiversity Loss: Sum up the biodiversity loss for all countries to get a global picture.
- Country-Specific Details: Provide detailed results for each country, which can be useful for policy-making and targeted conservation efforts.

## Considerations:
- Data Accuracy: Ensure the data used is accurate and up-to-date.
- Local Variations: Be mindful of regional differences in biodiversity impact.
- Comparative Analysis: Consider comparing the results with other major crops to provide context.
- This exercise requires access to specific environmental and agricultural datasets, as well as expertise in environmental science and data analysis. If you have access to these resources and the necessary expertise, you can proceed with the calculation. If not, you may need to collaborate with experts in these fields.
